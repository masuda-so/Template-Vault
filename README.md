# Template Vault

An opinionated starter vault for Obsidian that gives you a clean structure for capturing notes, reviewing them over time, and organizing them with folder-based workflows and Bases views.

## What This Project Does

This repository is a ready-to-use Obsidian vault template. It combines:

- capture areas for ideas, projects, references, clippings, and periodic notes
- starter documentation for learning Obsidian in the Sandbox area
- prebuilt `.base` files in [Bases](Bases) for database-like views over your notes

Use it as a personal knowledge base, journal, project hub, or as a starting point for your own vault conventions.

## Why This Project Is Useful

- Starts simple: the top-level folders already separate short-lived notes, long-term references, and planning cycles.
- Encourages consistent organization: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly folders make recurring review habits easier to maintain.
- Supports structured note collections: the `.base` files cover common domains such as books, people, places, projects, trips, and ratings.
- Includes onboarding material: the Sandbox area helps new Obsidian users learn links, formatting, and basic workflows.
- Stays local-first: content is stored as Markdown files, so your notes remain portable and easy to version with Git.

## Get Started

### 1. Clone or download the vault

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masuda-so/Template-Vault.git
```

Or download the repository as a ZIP and extract it locally.

### 2. Open the folder in Obsidian

1. Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
2. Choose Open folder as vault.
3. Select this repository folder.

### 3. Start with the built-in onboarding notes

- Read [ようこそ.md](ようこそ.md) for a guided vault tour and first-steps checklist.
- Open [Sandbox/Start here.md](Sandbox/Start%20here.md) for a hands-on Obsidian introduction.
- Continue with [Sandbox/Guides/Get started with Obsidian.md](Sandbox/Guides/Get%20started%20with%20Obsidian.md).

### 4. Enable Obsidian Core Plugins

Open **Settings → Core plugins** and turn on:

| Plugin | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Templates** | Insert templates from the `Templates/` folder |
| **Daily notes** | Create date-stamped notes in `Daily/` with one click |
| **Bases** | Browse notes as tables or cards using the `.base` files in `Bases/` |

After enabling Templates, set **Settings → Templates → Template folder location** to `Templates`.

### 5. Begin using the folder structure

A practical starting workflow:

1. Capture quick thoughts in [Ideas](Ideas).
2. Move actionable work into [Projects](Projects).
3. Keep source material in [References](References) or [Clippings](Clippings).
4. Review open work in [Weekly](Weekly) and [Monthly](Monthly).

### 6. Explore Bases views

The [Bases](Bases) directory contains `.base` files for common collections such as books, music, people, places, projects, recipes, shows, and trips. Open them in Obsidian with the Bases feature enabled to browse related notes as tables or cards.

## Obsidian Configuration Policy

The `.obsidian/` directory is **not tracked** in this repository (see `.gitignore`).

Each user's Obsidian configuration—themes, installed plugins, workspace layout—is personal and device-specific. Tracking it would cause conflicts when multiple people use the same vault on different machines or with different Obsidian versions.

After cloning, enable the plugins listed in **Get Started → Step 4** above to restore the intended experience.

## About the `.claude/` Directory

The `.claude/` directory contains [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) configuration files, including skills and prompt context used during development of this repository. It is tracked intentionally so that contributors using Claude Code can benefit from the same context when working on vault structure improvements.

If you are not using Claude Code, you can safely ignore this directory.

## Usage Examples

The following examples are based on patterns from the obsidian-skills content under [.claude/skills](.claude/skills).

### 1. Obsidian Markdown note example

Create a note using wikilinks, callouts, and embeds:

```md

title: Project Alpha
date: 2024-01-15
tags:
  - project
  - active
status: in-progress

### 2. Bases file example

Create a `.base` file (for example, `tasks.base` in [Bases](Bases)):

```yaml
filters:
  and:
    - file.hasTag("task")
    - 'file.ext == "md"'

formulas:
  days_until_due: 'if(due, (date(due) - today()).days, "")'

views:
  - type: table
    name: "Active Tasks"
    filters:
      and:
        - 'status != "done"'
    order:
      - file.name
      - status
      - due
      - formula.days_until_due
```

### 3. JSON Canvas file example

Create a `.canvas` file (for example, `research.canvas` in [Canvases](Canvases)):

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b",
      "type": "text",
      "x": 0,
      "y": 0,
      "width": 300,
      "height": 150,
      "text": "# Main Idea\\n\\nThis is the central concept."
    },
    {
      "id": "1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b",
      "type": "text",
      "x": 400,
      "y": -100,
      "width": 250,
      "height": 100,
      "text": "## Supporting Point A\\n\\nDetails here."
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d",
      "fromNode": "8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b",
      "fromSide": "right",
      "toNode": "1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b",
      "toSide": "left"
    }
  ]
}
```
